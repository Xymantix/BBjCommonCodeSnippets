# BBjCommonCodeSnippets
**What**:
A collection of BBj code samples that are commonly used when writing graphical applications, and web applications in particular.

**Why**:
Whenever I start on a new application, I realize that I usually need to replicate a bunch of code that I've come to rely upon
from applications that I've written previously.  It occurred to me that instead of digging through previous applications for
useful code, I could extract the useful portions and add them to a library of useful code.  After doing that for a while, I
realized that it would be nice to have a Git repository for the samples.  I also figured that some of the code snippets
might be useful to other BBj programmers, so I created a public repo for them.

**Who**:
This repo is created under my Xymantix account, but my real name is Nick Decker and (as of this writing) I've been a BASIS employee
for just over 35 years.  While I've been programming computers for decades, one of my greatest pleasures is writing web applications
that I use during daily life.  I was on BASIS' DWC (Dynamic Web Client) team and worked closely with other BASIS engineers
developing the DWC, so I usually default to writing DWC applications.  In addition to being able to run on the web in a browser,
I often write apps that I can run on my smartphone.  I like to write visually appealing application that rely on CSS for both
modifying the look and feel as well as providing responsive layouts using CSS Grid and CSS Flebox.
